		In this experiment, we were interested in examining how you use information provided by two experts that differed in their calibration.
		Both experts predicted the winner of each race at a better-than-chance level. However, one expert made well-calibrated judgements with respect to their confidence level.
		When the well-calibrated expert expressed high confidence, they were more accurate than when they expressed moderate confidence.
		The other expert maintained the same level of accuracy regardless of whether they expressed high or moderate confidence.  
		We are evaluating which of the two experts - the well-calibrated and non-calibrated expert - were you more likely to take advice from. 
		This study is relevant to how people weigh and integrate information from sources that may vary in their accuracy or metacognitive reliability.
